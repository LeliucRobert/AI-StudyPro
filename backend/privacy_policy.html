    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to AI StudyPro, an extension designed to assist users in learning
      and understanding web content with AI-based features. We value your
      privacy and aim to be transparent about how we collect, use, and process
      data.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose of the Extension</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of AI StudyPro (the "Extension") is to enhance your learning
      experience by providing AI-driven assistance for summarization,
      explanations, and finding similar pages related to the content you are
      viewing.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      In order to provide a personalized and effective experience, we collect
      certain information from the web pages you visit, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Page Title:</strong> We collect the title of the web page you
        are on to give context to the AI for generating relevant responses, and
        also to search for similar pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Page Content:</strong> The text content of the web page is
        collected to allow the AI to generate summaries, explanations, or
        similar page recommendations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The collected data (page title and content) is used solely for the
      following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Generate Summaries:</strong> Summarizing long texts into
        simpler, more concise explanations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Provide Related Pages:</strong> Offering suggestions for similar
        pages for further learning and exploration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contextual AI Responses:</strong> Providing contextually
        relevant AI responses based on the page's content.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>
      We do not store any personal data or browsing history. The data collected
      is processed temporarily for generating the response and is discarded
      immediately after the task is complete. All interactions with the AI are
      secured to protect your information.
    </p>
